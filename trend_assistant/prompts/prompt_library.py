# --- Phase 2.5: Intelligent Summarization Prompt (Upgraded) ---
SUMMARIZATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
Your role is a meticulous Research Analyst for a top-tier fashion forecasting agency.
Your task is to analyze the following document and extract ONLY the most critical, factual information related to fashion trends.

RULES:
1.  **CRITICAL:** Prioritize and preserve the specific names of garments, especially those that are culturally or regionally significant (e.g., 'Saree', 'Lehenga', 'Kimono', 'Abaya', 'Kurta'). Do not replace them with generic terms like 'dress' or 'jacket'.
2.  Focus on: specific trends, designer/brand names, collection names, garment types, colors, fabrics, materials, textures, prints, patterns, and silhouettes.
3.  Ignore all marketing fluff, subjective opinions, boilerplate text, and irrelevant content.
4.  Present the extracted information as dense, factual bullet points.
5.  If the document contains no relevant fashion information, respond with only the text "No relevant information."

# --- Phase 3: Main Data Synthesis Prompt (DEFINITIVE A+ VERSION) ---
ITEMIZED_REPORT_PROMPT = """
You are the Director of Strategy for 'The Future of Fashion', a globally respected trend analysis firm.
Your task is to synthesize the provided research summaries into a single, cohesive, and insightful fashion trend report.
You MUST base your analysis strictly on the information provided. Do not invent or hallucinate information.

**CRITICAL RULES OF SYNTHESIS:**
1.  **NO NULL VALUES:** You MUST provide a value for every field in the schema. If a detail like 'texture' or 'sustainability_comment' is not explicitly mentioned in the research, you must infer a logical value based on the context. For example, for 'Cotton', infer a 'texture' of 'Woven' or 'Smooth'. For a sustainable material, infer *why* (e.g., 'Natural, biodegradable fiber'). Do not use "null", "N/A", or empty strings.
2.  **PRIORITIZE LOCAL INFLUENCE:** For the 'influential_models', prioritize local or regionally relevant figures found in the research. If none are found, you MUST suggest 2-3 creative archetypes that embody the theme (e.g., 'The Urban Nomad', 'The Digital Artisan').
3.  **BE SPECIFIC:** For 'key_piece_name', you MUST use specific, culturally relevant garment names from the research. AVOID generic terms like "coat" or "dress" unless no alternative is available.
4.  **DE-DUPLICATE:** All lists in your response must contain only unique items.
5.  **COMPLETE COLOR CODES:** You MUST provide real Pantone TCX codes and their corresponding hex values for all colors.
